Dataset Name: Panama_Leaf_Traits_2007 Dates of data collection: August 2007 - December 2007 Number of traits: 6, Number of species: 24

SITE Study site: Mont Saint-Hilaire & immediate surroundings, Montérégie, Québec, Canada Boundary coordinates North: 45°34'32.1"N (45.575578) Boundary coordinates South: 45°31'44.8"N (45.529022) Boundary coordinates East: 73°11'41.2"W (-73.194784) Boundary coordinates West: 73°07'43.6"W ( -73.128778) Data georeferenced: yes

STUDY ORGANISMS 15-20 individuals measured per species. Ontogenetic stage: Sapling. Size criteria: diameter of individual at breast height (at 1.3m from ground) ranging from 1-5cm + height of individual less than 2/3 of canopy height when a canopy was present. For selection of individuals and leaves, see details in Messier et al. 2017. J.Ecol.

DATA TRANSFORMS: First, gollowing Kerkhoff and Enquist (2009), size and growth related traits were natural-log transformed (LMA, Leaf Area, Branch diameter, KS and KBRANCH ). All other traits were transformed following individual Box-Cox transformations to optimize normality when necessary. Second, we recorded all sampling dates, tested for possible phenological effects on trait values, and removed them when the effect was statistically significant. To do so, we used the residuals of the regression between each trait and the sampling date in lieu of the uncorrected trait value. Last, data were standardized (z-transformed) to allow comparison across traits with different units and scales.
